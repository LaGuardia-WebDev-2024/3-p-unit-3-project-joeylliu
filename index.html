  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Melt the chocolate (save some chocolate for later) and spread the chocolate thinly on the mold. Place the mold in the refridgerator
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toast the kataifi with butter. 
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the pistachio cream mixture with the kataifi.
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the chocolate mold is ready, take it out of the fridge and put the kataifi on it.
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the chocolate is filled with kataifi, put the leftover melted chocolate on top of it and place the mold in the fridge once more.
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After around 10 minutes, the chocolate should be ready to eat!
